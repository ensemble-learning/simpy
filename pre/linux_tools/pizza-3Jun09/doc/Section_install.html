<H3>2. Installing Pizza.py 
</H3>
<P>Unpack the Pizza.py distribution by typing the following:
</P>
<PRE>gunzip pizza.tar.gz
tar xvf pizza.tar 
</PRE>
<P>The Pizza.py main directory should then contain the following
directories:
</P>
<DIV ALIGN=center><TABLE  BORDER=1 >
<TR><TD >README</TD><TD >			   initial instructions</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >LICENSE</TD><TD >		   the GNU open-source license</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >doc</TD><TD >			   HTML documentation for Pizza.py</TD></TR>

<TR><TD >scripts</TD><TD >		   various Pizza.py script files</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >src</TD><TD >			   source code for Pizza.py and its tools 
</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<P>Because Python is an interpreted language, there is no need to compile
or "make" Pizza.py.  You run Pizza.py by executing the src/pizza.py
file directly, as described below.  However there are 3 issues to
consider: (a) you must have Python installed on your machine, (b) some
Pizza.py tools require your Python to be extended with additional
Python packages, and (c) some Pizza.py tools are wrappers on other
software which needs to be available on your system.
</P>
<P>If you don't plan to use a particular Pizza.py tool, you don't need to
install additional Python packages or other software it requires.

instructions on this page are incorrect or incomplete or you can
provide a better description of the install procedure, please send an
email to sjplimp@sandia.gov.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "2_1"></A>Installing Python 
</H4>
<P>Python is open-source software available for Unix, Macintosh, and
Windows machines.  If you have a Linux box or Mac it is probably
already installed.  If the python executable is in your path, typing
"python" should give you a Python prompt ">>>" and tell you what
version you are running.  Version 2.4 or newer is sufficiently current
to run Pizza.py, though older versions may work as well.
</P>
<P>If Python is not installed on your machine, go to
<A HREF = "http://www.python.org">www.python.org</A> to download a binary or
source-code version and then build and/or install it.
</P>
<P>On my Linux box, this was as easy as
</P>
<PRE>./configure; make; sudo make install 
</PRE>
<P>To use the Pizza.py tools that have GUIs, you need to
insure your Python supports Tcl/Tk via the Tkinter module.  This is
the case if you can type the following from your Python prompt:
</P>
<PRE>>>> import Tkinter
>>> Tkinter._test() 
</PRE>
<P>If this fails, see further instructions below for Tkinter.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are installing a new version of Python, read
the Tkinter section first, since it describes how to make sure the
Tcl/Tk and Togl libraries are installed.  If you want to use the
Pizza.py tools that require them, you need to do this step first
before building Python.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "2_2"></A>Running Pizza.py 
</H4>
<P>Typically Pizza.py should be run from the directory where your LAMMPS
or other data files are.  Like any Python program, Pizza.py can be run
in one of 2 ways, by typing either
</P>
<PRE>python -i ~/pizza/src/pizza.py
~/pizza/src/pizza.py 
</PRE>
<P>where the last argument is the full pathname of the pizza.py file.
</P>
<P>The -i switch leaves Python in interactive mode (instead of exiting)
after the pizza.py script is run.  In the 2nd case, if the src dir is
in your path, just pizza.py could be typed.  For the 2nd case, you
must also set src/pizza.py to be an executable file (chmod +x
pizza.py) and edit the 1st line of pizza.py to reflect where Python
lives on your system (find it by typing "which python"), e.g.
</P>
<PRE>#!/usr/local/bin/python -i 
</PRE>
<P>Putting a definition like one of the following in your .cshrc file (or
equivalent syntax for other Unix shell start-up files) will let you
simply type "pizza" at the command-line to start Pizza.py.
</P>
<P>alias pizza python -i ~/pizza/src/pizza.py
alias pizza ~/pizza/src/pizza.py
</P>
<P>Pizza.py accepts several command-line options; they are described in
<A HREF = "Section_basics.html">this section</A> of the documentation.
</P>
<P>When Pizza.py starts, it reads a few values from the src/DEFAULTS.py
file (described below) and imports the *.py files from the src
directory as Python modules.  These are the Pizza.py tools.  Error
messages will be printed if your Python has not been extended with a
Python package that a tool requires.  If you don't plan to use the
tool you can ignore the message, or exclude that tool via the
command-line switch "-x".
</P>
<P>Once all tools have been loaded and any initial scripts and commands
have been run (via command-line arguments) you should see the Pizza.py
">" prompt.  From this point on, everything you type is a Python
command.  Python interprets what you type, operates on your data, and
produces output or error messages, just as if you were typing in
response to Python's interactive prompt ">>>".
</P>
<P>You can also type special commands that have been added to the Python
interpreter by Pizza.py or commands that invoke Pizza.py tools.  More
details about these options are explained in <A HREF = "Section_basics.html">this
section</A> of the documentation.
</P>
<P>As with Python, type Ctrl-D to exit Pizza.py at any time.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "2_3"></A>Setting up the DEFAULTS.py file 
</H4>
<P>When Pizza.py starts it reads 3 values from the src/DEFAULTS.py file:
</P>
<DIV ALIGN=center><TABLE  BORDER=1 >
<TR><TD >PIZZA_TOOLS</TD><TD > directories that contain additional Pizza.py tools</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >PIZZA_SCRIPTS</TD><TD > directories that contain additional Pizza.py scripts</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >PIZZA_EXCLUDE</TD><TD > Python files that are not loaded, since they are not tools 
</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<P>These are designed to allow users to augment Pizza.py with their own
tools and scripts, which need not be stored in the directories of the
Pizza.py pacakge.  Follow the instructions in the DEFAULTS.py file for
using these options.
</P>
<P>The DEFAULTS.py files also contains various variables that specify the
name and path of programs that Pizza.py tools will execute on your
system.  In some cases the variables contain settings that are used by
these programs.  Read the comments in the DEFAULTS.py file for more
information.
</P>
<P>The following table lists the keywords in the DEFAULTS.py, the program
or setting that will be used by default if the keyword line is
commented out, and the Pizza.py tools that use the keyword.  If the
program is not in your path or you wish to use an alternate program or
setting, you must edit the DEFAULTS.py file accordingly.  If you don't
plan to use any tool that needs the keyword, you can ignore its
setting.

<H4><A NAME = "2_4"></A>Installing additional Python packages 
</H4>
<P>This is the list of extra Python packages various Pizza.py tools
require.  If a tool is not listed it requires no extra packages.
Instructions on where to find the Python extensions and how to install
them are listed below.
</P>
<DIV ALIGN=center><TABLE  BORDER=1 >

<TR><TD >Tkinter </TD><TD > animate, image, plotview, vcr 
</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<HR>

<H4>Numeric 
</H4>
<P><A HREF = "http://numeric.scipy.org">Numeric</A> enables Python to process vectors and arrays of
numbers efficiently, both in terms of memory and CPU speed.  It's an
extremely useful extension to have in your Python if you do any
numerical work on large data sets.  Note that Pizza.py uses the older
(but still popular) Numeric package, not the newer numarray package.
</P>
<P>If Numeric is already installed in your Python, you should be able to
type the following without getting an error:
</P>
<PRE>>>> import Numeric 
</PRE>
<P>Numeric can be downloaded from <A HREF = "http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1369&package_id=1351">this site</A> on SourceForge.  As
of July 2007, Version 24.2 was fine.  Once unpacked, you can type the
following from the Numeric directory to install it in your Python.
</P>
<PRE>sudo python setup.py install 
</PRE>
<P>On my Linux box, when Numeric installed itself under the Python lib in
/usr/local, it did not set all file permsissions correctly to allow a
user to import it.  So I also needed to do this:
</P>
<PRE>sudo chmod -R 755 /usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/Numeric 
</PRE>




<HR>

<H4>PIL 
</H4>
<P>The PIL (<A HREF = "http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil">Python Imaging Library</A>) allows Python to read image
files, manipulate them, and convert between several common image
formats.
</P>




<P>If PIL is already installed in your Python, you should be able to type
the following without getting an error:
</P>
<PRE>>>> import Image,ImageTk 
</PRE>
<P>PIL can be downloaded from <A HREF = "http://effbot.org/zone/pil-index.htm">this site</A>.  As of July 2007,
Version 1.1.6 is fine.  On my Linux box, this command installed it:
</P>
<PRE>sudo python setup.py install 
</PRE>
<P>with a notice that Tkinter and ZLIB (PNG) support were enabled.  If
you want the Pizza.py tools to recognize other image formats
(e.g. JPEG), then look at the README for further details, if the PIL
build did not find the correct libraries.
</P>
<HR>

<H4>Pmw 
</H4>
<P>Pmw (<A HREF = "http://pmw.sourceforge.net">Python mega-widgets</A>) is a common Tkinter extension that
provides a host of more powerful GUI widgets.
</P>


<P>If Pmw is already installed in your Python, you should be able to type
the following without getting an error:
</P>
<PRE>>>> import Pmw 
</PRE>
<P>Pmw can be downloaded from <A HREF = "http://pmw.sourceforge.net">this site</A>.  As of July 2007, Version
1.2 is fine.  Pmw is installed by putting its files in your Python's
site-packages directory.  After unpacking the tarball and
naming the resulting dir "pmw", I installed it on my Linux
box as follows:
</P>
<PRE>sudo cp -r pmw /usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/Pmw
sudo chmod -R 755 /usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/Pmw 
</PRE>
<HR>

<H4>PyOpenGL 
</H4>
<P>The <A HREF = "http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net">PyOpenGL</A> package is a wrapper on the ubiquitous OpenGL
graphics library and allows a Python program to make graphics calls in
standard OpenGL syntax.  It also includes Togl support for opening a
Tk OpenGL widget, assuming your Python has Tkinter intstalled and that
Tkinter was built with Togl (read on!).  The Pizza.py tools that use
PyOpenGL require this capability.
</P>


<P>If PyOpenGL is already installed in your Python, you should be able to
type the following without getting an error:
</P>
<PRE>>>> import OpenGL 
</PRE>
<P>If your PyOpenGL supports Togl, you should be able to type the
following without getting an error:
</P>
<PRE>>>> from OpenGL.Tk import *
>>> from OpenGL.GLUT import * 
</PRE>
<P>PyOpenGL can be downloaded from <A HREF = "http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net">this site</A> on SourceForge.
You want the latest PyOpenGL release (not OpenGLContext).  As of July
2007, Version 3.0.0a6 is what I used.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: I had many problems installing earlier versions of
PyOpenGL on various boxes.  But the 3.0 release was much easier to
install on my Linux box, as outlined here.  Note that version 3.0
requires Python 2.4 or later.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE #2: By default, your Python may or may not have Tkinter
installed.  Even if Tkinter is installed, it probably was not built
with Togl.  If this is the case, you should install them first before
installing PyOpenGl, otherwise you will still get errors when you try
to use the Pizza.py tools that use PyOpenGL, because they require
Tkinter and Togl.  See the Tkinter section below for instructions on
installing Tkinter and Togl in your Python.
</P>
<P>Installing 3.0 version of PyOpenGL requires the setuptools package be
part of your Python.  As of July 2007, it can be downloaded from <A HREF = "http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools">this
site</A>.  It is a single file, ez_setup.py, which can be
installed in your Python by typing:
</P>
<PRE>sudo python ez_setup.py 
</PRE>


<P>Once setuptools and Tkinter and Togl are in place, installing PyOpenGL
on my Linux box was as simple as:
</P>
<PRE>sudo python setup.py install 
</PRE>
<HR>

<H4>readline 
</H4>
<P>The <A HREF = "http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/~chet/readline/rltop.html">readline</A> library is part of Python but is not supported
on all systems.  If it works in your Python, then Pizza.py (and
Python) prompts are more shell-like and should support arrow keys,
Emacs-style editing, command history, etc.  If you get an error "No
module named readline" when Pizza.py starts up, you can ignore it, or
comment out the line "import readline" in src/pizza.py.
</P>
<P>If readline is already installed in your Python, you should be able to
type the following without getting an error:
</P>
<PRE>>>> import readline 
</PRE>
<P>The readline library can be downloaded from <A HREF = "http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/~chet/readline/rltop.html#Availability">this site</A>.
After building the library, I believe you then have to rebuild Python
itself.
</P>




<HR>

<H4>Tkinter 
</H4>
<P>The Tkinter package is part of Python but is not always enabled when
Python is built, typically due to not finding the Tcl/Tk libraries.
If you can type the following without an error message in your Python,
then Tkinter is operational in your Python:
</P>
<PRE>>>> import Tkinter
>>> Tkinter._test() 
</PRE>
<P>If this fails, you need to rebuild Python and either insure it finds
the Tcl/Tk libraries or build those libraries first as described here.
Since I wanted a more current Python then was installed with Linux on
my box, I download the latest Python (Python 2.5.1 as of July 2007)
and installed it under /usr/local.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: If you want to use any of the Pizza.py tools that use
PyOpenGL, you also need the Togl library.  You should install it
before building the Tcl/Tk libraries which you then build before
re-building Python, as described here.  Unfortunately, if Tkinter is
already in your Python but without Togl support, I think you need to
go thru these 3 steps in order.
</P>
<P>(1) To intstall Togl, download it from <A HREF = "http://togl.sourceforge.net">this site</A> on
SourceForge.  As of July 2007, Version 1.7 is fine.
</P>


<P>After unpacking the tarball, installing it on my Linux box was
as simple as:
</P>
<PRE>./configure; make; sudo make install 
</PRE>
<P>(2) To build Tck/Tk libraries with Togl support, go to <A HREF = "http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10894">this
site</A> on SourceForce to download the latest versions of Tcl and
Tk.
</P>


<P>As of July 2007, I was unable to build version 8.4.15 on my Redhat
Linux box due to an odd error, but 8.4.7 built fine.  After unpacking
the two tarballs I did the following:
</P>
<PRE>cd tcl8.4.7/unix
./configure; make; sudo make install 
cd tk8.4.7/unix
./configure; make; sudo make install 
</PRE>
<P>This build should find the Togl library previously installed under
/usr/local.
</P>
<P>(3) Now you can re-build Python and it should find the correct Tcl/Tk
libraries under /usr/local.  Note that when you run ./configure as the
first step in building Python, it will tell you what it found for
Tcl/Tk.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "2_5"></A>Installing other software 
</H4>
<P>Some Pizza.py tools invoke other software which must be installed on
your system for the tool to work.  This is an alphabetic list of the
needed software.  Except where noted, it is freely available for
download on the WWW.  The Pizza.py tools that use this software are
listed above in <A HREF = "#2_3">this section</A>.  To see if you already have the
software on your box, type "which command", e.g. "which display".
</P>
<H4>ImageMagick display, convert, montage commands 
</H4>
<P>Several Pizza.py tools display image files.  The ImageMagick "display"
program can be used for this purpose.  Likewise, the ImageMagick
"convert" and "montage" comands are used by the image tool.  The
ImageMagick toolkit can be downloaded from <A HREF = "http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">this site</A> and
contains a variety of useful image conversion and manipulation
software.
</P>


<H4>GnuPlot 
</H4>
<P>The Pizza.py gnu tool is a wrapper on the open-source GnuPlot program.
GnuPlot can be downloaded from <A HREF = "http://www.gnuplot.info">this site</A>.
</P>


<H4>Gunzip 
</H4>
<P>Gunzip is invoked by Python to read compressed (*.gz) data and dump
files.  It is almost certainly on your Unix system.  If not if can be
downloaded from <A HREF = "http://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/gzip.html">this site</A>.
</P>


<H4>Label3d 
</H4>
<P>The Pizza.py tool raster uses the label3d and render programs from the
Raster3d visualization package to produce high-quality ray-traced
images.  See the description of "Render" below for information about
Raster3d.
</P>
<H4>MatLab 
</H4>
<P>The Pizza.py matlab tool is a wrapper on MatLab which is a widely-used
commercial numerical analysis package that also produces nice plots.
Further information is available at <A HREF = "http://www.mathworks.com">the MathWorks WWW site</A>.
When MatLab is installed on your system and the appropriate
environment variables are set, the command "matlab" should launch the
program.
</P>


<H4>RasMol 
</H4>
<P>The Pizza.py rasmol tool invokes the RasMol visualization package to
view molecular systems and produce nice images.  RasMol can be
downloaded from <A HREF = "http://www.openrasmol.org">this site</A>, which is for the original
open-source version of RasMol, not the Protein Explorer derivative
version of RasMol.
</P>


<P>Note that when using RasMol on a Mac, you will need to launch X11
first (or run Pizza.py from an X11 xterm) to get RasMol to display
properly.
</P>
<H4>Render 
</H4>
<P>The Pizza.py tool raster uses the render and label3d programs from the
Raster3d visualization package to produce high-quality ray-traced
images.  Raster3d can be downloaded from <A HREF = "http://www.bmsc.washington.edu/raster3d/raster3d.html">this site</A>.
</P>


<P>For Macs, Raster3d is available for download via <A HREF = "http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/package.php/raster3d">Fink</A> as an
<A HREF = "http://fink.sourceforge.net/faq/usage-fink.php?phpLang=en#unstable">unstable package</A>.
</P>
