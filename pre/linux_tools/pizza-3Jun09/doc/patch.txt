patch tool :h3

[Purpose:]

Create patchy Lennard-Jones particles for LAMMPS input.

[Description:]

The patch tool creates large multi-atom particles and writes them out
as a LAMMPS data file.  They need to be simulated with a soft
potential in LAMMPS to un-overlap them before they form a proper
ensemble.

The individual particles consist of a collection of Lennard-Jones
atoms of various types.  By defining force field coefficients
appropriately, specific atoms can be made attractive or repulsive, so
that "patches" of atoms on the particle surface are reactive.  The
"Pizza.py WWW site"_pws has example images and movies of simulations
using such particles.  A "paper"_#Glotzer by "Sharon Glotzer's
group"_glotzer at U Michigan describing a variety of patchy particle
models was the motivation for this tool.

The patch constructor takes a volume fraction as an argument to determine
how densely to fill the simulation box.  Optionally, the box shape can
also be specified.

The build() method creates N particles, each of speficied style and
with specified atom types.  Several styles are available and new ones
can easily be added to patch.py.  You will need to look in patch.py
for the details of what each style represents.  For example, "hex2"
uses a C60 bucky ball as a template and creates hexagonal 6-atom
patches (atoms of a different type) on either side of the ball.

The build() method can be invoked multiple times to create collections
of particles.  The position and orientation of each particle is chosen
randomly.  The seed value sets the random number generator used for
coordinate generation.

The ensemble of chains is written to a LAMMPS data file via the
write() method.

[Usage:]

p = patch(vfrac)           setup box with a specified volume fraction
p = patch(vfrac,1,1,2)     x,y,z = aspect ratio of box (def = 1,1,1) :pre

p.seed = 48379		   set random # seed (def = 12345)
p.dim = 2		   set dimension of created box (def = 3)
p.blen = 0.97              set length of tether bonds (def = 0.97)
p.dmin = 1.02              set min r from i-1 to i+1 tether site (def = 1.02) :pre

p.build(100,"hex2",1,2,3)  create 100 "hex2" particles with types 1,2,3 :pre
