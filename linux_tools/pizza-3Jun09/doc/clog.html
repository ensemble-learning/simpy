<H3>clog tool 
</H3>
<P><B>Purpose:</B>
</P>
<P>Read ChemCell and SPPARKS log files and extract time-series data.
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Read one or more ChemCell log files and combine their species
statistical data into long, named vectors (versus time).  The vectors
can be used in Python for further processing and plotting, or they can
be output to a file.
</P>
<P>The log constructor reads one or more log files.  If 2 arguments are
specified, a single file is specified, and it is assumed to contain
data for multiple runs, which are averaged.
</P>
<P>The nvec, nlen, and names values give the # of vectors, their length,
and names.  The get() method returns one of more vectors as a Python
list.  The write() method outputs the numeric vectors to a file.
</P>
<P><B>Usage:</B>
</P>
<PRE>c = clog("file1")                    read in one or more log files
c = clog("log1 log2.gz")             can be gzipped
c = clog("file*")                    wildcard expands to multiple files
c = clog("log.cell","Time")          2nd arg = start string for time section
c = clog("log.cell","",0)            3rd arg = average all runs 
</PRE>
<PRE>  incomplete and duplicate thermo entries are deleted
  if specify 2nd arg, it delimits a time section
  no 2nd arg or empty string, use default which is ChemCell specific
  if specify any 3rd arg, average all runs, assume all start at time 0 
</PRE>
<PRE>nvec = c.nvec                        # of vectors of thermo info
nlen = c.nlen                        length of each vectors
names = c.names                      list of vector names
a,b,... = c.get("A","B",...)         return one or more vectors of values
c.write("file.txt")	 	     write all vectors to a file
c.write("file.txt","A","B",...)      write listed vectors to a file 
</PRE>
<PRE>  get and write allow abbreviated (uniquely) vector names
